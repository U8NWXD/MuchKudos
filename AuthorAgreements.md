# Author Agreements

This file tracks decisions made collectively by the authors. Each
individual's agreement is recorded by their placement of an `x`
within the brackets (`[]`) next to his or her name. This is rendered
by GitHub as a checked checkbox, or an unchecked one without
the `x` This agreement is then verified by his or her git commit of
that change.
