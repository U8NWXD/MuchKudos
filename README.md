#  MuchKudos README
[![CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/readme/badge/U8NWXD/MuchKudos)](https://cla-assistant.io/U8NWXD/MuchKudos)

## Description

MuchKudos is an iOS app for facilitating the sharing of compliments and congratulations
within college residences. While still a work in progress, it is intended to make easier the
process of sending "kudos" to others. Residence leadership will then be able to view all
submitted kudos and present them to the community during meetings.

## Usage

**The source code provided is incomplete.** We rely on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)
for our database and for user authentication, so you need to create and configure a Firebase
project. Add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from Firebase to the project at
`MuchKudos/GoogleService-Info.plist`. Xcode should then be able to run the app.

In addition, you will probably want to replace the `ArroyoSticker` image with a logo of`
your choice.

Note that some configuration of Firebase libraries using CocoaPods may be needed.
